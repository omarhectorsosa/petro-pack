# Upgrade from 0.5 to 0.6

## Configuration changes

Configuration of the bundle was changed so that it would be more clear
and semantic:
- `twig.function_name` was removed and is always `webpack_asset`;
- `asset_providers` was totally removed, use the following instead:
  - `enabled_bundles` to parse twig templates only in some bundles that you
  need;
  - `twig.additional_directories` to parse twig templates in additional provided
  directories. `%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/views` is always parsed if it exists;
  - custom asset providers does not need additional configuration and are always
  called;
- `aliases.register_bundles` was removed - it's now the same as `enabled_bundles`
- `bin.webpack.tty_prefix` and `bin.dev_server.tty_prefix` were removed and
`dashboard` configuration node added instead. This makes the bundle aware of
`WebpackDashboard` explicitly, so now it passes `WEBPACK_DASHBOARD` environment
variable into `webpack.config.js` (with value `enabled`) if dashboard is used,
`TTY_MODE` is no passed.
This also allows extending functionality if some other changes to dashboard
would be needed;
- default `webpack.config.js` configuration extracts CSS by default, so if you
had `config.parameters.extract_css` set to `true`, you could just remove it.
If it was not set and you do not need extracting CSS, set `config.parameters.extract_css`
to `false`;
- default executables were changed from `[node, node_modules/package/bin/package.js]`
into `[node_modules/.bin/package]` - this should be backwards compatible.

So, if you had this configuration:
```yml
maba_webpack:
    asset_providers:
        -
            type:     twig_bundles
            resource: [ApplicationBundle]
        -
            type:     twig_directory
            resource: %kernel.root_dir%/Resources/views
        -
            type:     twig_directory
            resource: %kernel.root_dir%/Resources/other-directory
    aliases:                            # allows to set aliases inside require() in your JS files
        register_bundles:               # defaults to all bundles
            - ApplicationBundle
    bin:
        webpack:
            tty_prefix: [/my/path/to/node, node_modules/webpack-dashboard/bin/webpack-dashboard.js]
        dev_server:
            tty_prefix: [/my/path/to/node, node_modules/webpack-dashboard/bin/webpack-dashboard.js]
```

Now it would be like this:
```yml
maba_webpack:
    enabled_bundles:
        - ApplicationBundle
    twig:
        additional_directories:
            - %kernel.root_dir%/Resources/other-directory
    config:
        parameters:
            extract_css: false
    dashboard:
        enabled: always
        executable: [/my/path/to/node, node_modules/webpack-dashboard/bin/webpack-dashboard.js]
```

## Changed twig tags

Removed `webpack_javascript`, `webpack_stylesheets` and `webpack_assets` twig
tags - replace them with `webpack` tag and use `js` or `css` token if needed.

Change this:
```twig
{% webpack_javascripts '@app/a.js' '@app/b.js' %}
<script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
{% end_webpack_javascripts %}

{% webpack_stylesheets '@app/a.js' '@app/b.js' %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}"/>
{% end_webpack_stylesheets %}

{% webpack_assets '@app/a.png' '@app/b.png' %}
<img src="{{ asset_url }}"/>
{% end_webpack_assets %}
```

To this:
```twig
{% webpack js '@app/a.js' '@app/b.js' %}
<script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
{% end_webpack %}

{% webpack css '@app/a.js' '@app/b.js' %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}"/>
{% end_webpack %}

{% webpack '@app/a.png' '@app/b.png' %}
<img src="{{ asset_url }}"/>
{% end_webpack %}
```

This allows extending functionality (like adding `named` for commons chunk assets)
and still using single tag.

## Migrating to Webpack 2

This bundle was already compatible with Webpack 2 if custom `webpack.config.js` was used - 
this configuration and your assets themselves are affected by Webpack version.

From this version, default `webpack.config.js` was added for Webpack 2 -
`maba:webpack:setup` command installs Webpack 2 by default.

If you want to keep Webpack 1, update configuration file by providing command line option:
```bash
app/console maba:webpack:setup --useWebpackV1
```

Configuration itself kept all the loaders and plugins as they were in previous version.
One notable (and backwards incompatible) change is that `''` is no longer in `resolve.modules`.
Webpack just does not allow it anymore. This affects your codebase if you `require`d relative
assets without `./` or `../` prefix.

If you have something like this:
```js
require('asset1.js');   // asset1.js is in the same directory
require('styles.css');  // styles.css is in parent directory
```

You'll have to provide relative paths explicitly:

```js
require('./asset1.js');
require('../styles.css');
```

## Asset providers refactored

Asset provider functionality was refactored - this is important only
if you implemented `AssetProviderInterface` or `CollectionResourceInterface`
in your code. Changes:
- changed `AssetResult` class - collection of assets are now `AssetItem`
instances instead of strings
- changed `AssetProviderInterface::getAssets` - it does not take `$resource`
 as an argument anymore
- removed `CollectionResourceInterface` interface
- if you implement `AssetProviderInterface` and tag service with
`maba_webpack.asset_provider`, no further configuration is needed in
`config.yml` - `getAssets` will be always called and given assets compiled.

# Upgrade from 0.4 to 0.5

## TTY prefix

`bin.dev_server.tty_prefix` was added with
`['node', 'node_modules/webpack-dashboard/bin/webpack-dashboard.js', '--']`
default value.

This requires changes in `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`.

You can set it to `[]` to disable NASA-like dashboard when compiling assets.
 
## AssetManager

Second parameter for `AssetManager::getAssetUrl` has been made optional.
If not provided, it is figured by configuration so that binary files could be loaded with `webpack_asset` twig function.

## Non-Javascript Entry File Support

Now you can use `webpack_asset` on other files than `.js` - for example, for images.

This requires changes in `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`.

You can disable this by setting `entry_file.enabled` to `false` in `config.yml`.

You should always do this procedure after updating this bundle:
- run `maba:webpack:setup`, replace files and merge changes
- run `npm install` (this should be done with `composer install` (and) as a step in deployment)

## Explicit API for semantic versioning

Some interfaces, classes and class methods were marked with `@api`.
Any other classes or methods can be changed or removed without MAJOR release bump.

Also most of the services marked as private for the same reason - you should only use those that
are public.

## Deprecated setting custom twig function

`maba_webpack.twig.function_name` configuration option is deprecated and will be removed in 0.6
